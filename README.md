# MIT Facts Project
In this excercise we were tasked with solving and changing the code of 3 failed tests. Using Terminal to clone the repository from Github onto my computer, VS Code to adjust coding in the .js file and then finally pushing the changes back onto Github! 
<h1>How to run the task</h1>
<p>
  In order to accomplish you must have:
  1.Github account
  2.Terminal

  Start by forking the repository "mitfacts" on Github, then clone the forked repository onto your laptop using terminal(git clone [ForkedRepositoryAddress]), navigate to the forked repository in your computer, run command "npm install", once installed run a test using "npm test", find failed tests and the file where code needs to be corrected, correct the neeeded code, run new "npm test", if all tests have passed push new changes onto Github; 1. git add. 2. git commit -m 'description of action".
